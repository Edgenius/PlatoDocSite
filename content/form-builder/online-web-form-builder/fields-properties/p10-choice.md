# CHOICE PROPERTIES

### Multiple or Single Choice

Use the choice properties to allow the user to pick **one or multiple options**.

- **One Choice**
  By default, the user can only select one option. This is ideal for agreeing to a policy or Terms and Conditions.


- **Multiple Choice**
  Turn this on to allow multiple options. For example, selecting the colour of a product.


- **Other** 
  Turn on the other option to let the user enter custom text.

Additional fields:

- **Choice Label**
  The text defining the choice. For example, ***Yes*** or ***No***.


- **Tick Format**
  Use the Tick Format section to select whether to use a tick (check) or a cross when the submitted PDF is generated.

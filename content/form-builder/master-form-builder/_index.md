To build a master form, it doesn't need to upload a PDF in advance. In the form build, there are 3 main area: `Attributes`, `Preview` and `List of Widget`. From "Add" button on the top navigation bar, you can add new form widget. The widgets contain Text, Choice, Dropdown, Signature, Page Divider, Description, reCaptcha and File Upload. The first 4 widgets can be used to render content in your PDF when you link this master form to PDF later.

During the build, you can `Preview Form` anytime to check out what your form looks like. After you completed the form build, you can publish it to get a shared URL or the embedded script. 

It is the first step to complete the master form. After that, you can upload your PDF files as the linked forms.

After PDF upload, it redirects to a `Linked Form Editor`. It lists all widgets of your master form on its left side panel. You **cannot** add, delete, or modify its form attributes. After you add them to your PDF which is on your right side panel, you can edit its PDF attributes that decides how it displays. As mentioned above, only Text, Choice, Dropdown, Signature can be added to your PDF.

A tip here, you can add a widget to PDF multiple times, for example, if your PDF needs same personal sign every page, you can add the same signature widget to each page of the PDF, then the final generated PDF will contain this signature every page.

Likewise, you also need to `publish` this link form after you believe it is done. It prompts a shared URL or embedded script as well. But if you notice that, it is same value with the master form, i.e, whatever how many PDF you linked, you only have the unique sharing information. Because the end users only need to fill the mater form, then all linked PDF is created together.

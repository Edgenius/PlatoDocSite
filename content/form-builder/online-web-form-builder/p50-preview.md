# FORM PREVIEW

You can preview your form at any time by clicking *Preview Form* in the *Tools* menu.

The form previews are fully functioning; you can **fill them out** and **submit them** in the same way as a published form.

#### The Form Preview

## Disabling Form Validation

Typically, when you submit a form, it will run some validation checksâ€”for example, maximum characters, numeric value. On a live form this is a valuable process, but on a preview, it can cause complications.

Turn Form Validation **on** and **off** with the *toggle switch* in your preview *Toolbar*. This allows you to submit a form, even if the content is not valid.

### Filling Sample Data

To make previewing smoother, we recommend entering preview data for the fields you create. To do this, input your example data in the *Form Preview* section of your fields attributes panel.

When you preview your form, click *Fill Sample Data* in the top right *Toolbar*, and the fields will automatically populate with your example data. 

To preview the form rendered in PDF, just click *Preview PDF* in the *Form Builder*.

**Please note:** Some File Upload and Captcha field types do not accept sample data. You must enter these manually.



### Previewing the PDF after form submission

After submitting a form, you can **view the generated PDF** from the success page. Click *Preview PDF* in the top right *Toolbar*.

### Sample data and Default options

The *Choice* and *Dropdown* field types can have a default selected value added to them. This means that after loading, the default value is already pre-selected. 

**Sample selection** and **default selection** are different things that can run independently of each other. 

- **Sample selection**
  The option selected by clicking *Fill Sample Data* while previewing a form.


- **Default selection**
  The option automatically selected in a form by default.

After you upload the PDF, you will be redirected to form builder page. By default, it has 2 panels. The left side is for your `Web Form` editing. The right panel is for your `PDF` editing. From its top function bar, you can press `Add` button to add various fields. Some fields are sharing both in PDF and web form, such as Single Line Field, Choice and Signature etc. Some fields are only used for web form, such as Page Divider, Captcha and File Upload etc.

When you added a field that is shared by PDF and Form, it is inserted into both side panels. In right PDF panel, you can drag and drop that widget into the place where the field is located.  The widgets in left Web Form panel are also can be dragged and dropped to re-arrange the order of fields in the form. 

If your PDF is multiple pages, you can switch between pages on that page list menu in the right side of function bar.

While you are building, you can preview what the web form looks like by pressing `Preview Form` button. Likewise, you can preview the PDF by `Preview PDF` button. Before you preview the PDF, you can fill some [preview sample data](p20-preview#fill-sample-data) so that the PDF can be rendered with data even you don't submit the form.

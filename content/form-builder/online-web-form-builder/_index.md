  ​

## Building Your Form

Get started building your form. 

### Adding Fields to Your Form

At the top left of the page is the *Toolbar*. Use the ***+ Add*** button to add various fields to your form—options are categorised by compatibility; either *Form and PDF* or *Form Only*.

| Form and PDF | Form Only    |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Text Input   | Page Divider |
| Choice       | Description  |
| Dropdown     | ReCaptcha    |
| Signature    | File Upload  |

### Arranging the Widgets

When you add a field, its widget will appear in the panels below. If the field is compatible with both *Web Form* and *PDF*, you'll see it in both the left and right panels. 

* **In the Web Form Panel**
  Drag and drop your widget to quickly rearrange the order of the fields.
* **In the PDF panel**
  Drag the fields to map them to the correct section of your PDF.



### Working with Multiple Pages

If your PDF has multiple pages, you can switch between each page with the *Page Toggle* at the top of the *PDF* panel—it looks like this:

### Previewing Your Form

Preview your form or PDF at any time using the *Preview Form* and *Preview PDF* buttons in the top *Toolbar*.

<div class="notices tip" >We recommend adding some sample data to your PDF before previewing. This way the PDF is rendered with data.</tip>

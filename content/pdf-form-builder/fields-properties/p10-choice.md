## Multiple or Single Choice

In choice properties, you can decide your user is able to choose one or multiple options. For single choice, it normally knows as `Radio buttons` in your form which only allows one selection. For multiple choices, it knows as `Checkboxes` which allows multiple selections. You also can turn on an `Other Option` to allow user input some text. When the submission is generated into PDF, those selected options are rendered to a `tick` or `cross` sign. The other option text is rendered as text if its option is marked as selected.

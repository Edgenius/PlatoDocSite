You can turn off "Form Validation" from the top bar of preview page, so even you don't fill any data or your just filled some invalid data, you still can click "Next" button to jump to 2nd page.

For example, if you already input "John Joe"  in a text input field, at preview form, click "Fill Preview Data" button in the top function bar, the specified input field will automatically fill in "John Joe" as sample data. This can save lots of your time when you want to preivew generated PDF after form submitted.

If you choose Online PDF Form, it will redirect to a form builder that displays the PDF pages. You can pick up the input elements from the top functions bar and drag it to the place you want to fill in. The input elements can be a text input, checkbox, dropdown, image, or a signature.  

You can click `Preview` anytime to check out what the form looks like. It should be just your PDF pages with the corresponding input fields.  

After you complete the build, click `Publish` to get a URL or embedded script to share it.

# DROPDOWN PROPERTIES

Use the *drop-down* field to provide your users with multiple options; for example, selecting their home country. In the web form, this appears as a classic drop-down menu, like in the example below. However, in a PDF it is rendered as a text list.

## Value and Label

- **Item Label**
  The text that appears in the *dropdown* on the *web form*.
- **Item Value**
  The text that appears in the *dropdown* list on the *PDF form*.


In many cases, the *Value* and *Label* could be the same. But, you have the freedom to use different labels if you wish. For example, you might want to use country names on the *Web Form* and country codes on the *PDF*.

After your form gets submission, an email with the generated PDF is sent to your inbox. You also can check out the new submission notifications from our dashboard. 

`Submissions` page is a more powerful place to manage the submissions. From there, you can

* View the submissions data
* Search by submission data
* Export all raw data in CSV format
* Download, re-generate or delete PDF
* Download attached files if your form has `Upload File` fields

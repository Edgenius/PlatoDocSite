Workflow helps you fill a PDF in multiple step. 

To explanin what is workflow, let's start with a use case. For example, a car sale agency, they have a PDF needs their customers fill out the personal information.  Then the sales manager sign the PDF and approve the sale. With PlatoForm workflow, the agent can create a workflow with two steps. The first step is an Online Web Form which is for the customers. The second step could be PDF Online Form which has a signagure pad. The form can use customer's fill-out PDF as the temmplate, so the sales manager can easily understand what they approved for.

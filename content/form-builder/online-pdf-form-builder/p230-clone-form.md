This may happen very often - you modified your PDF slightly, either added a new field or adjusted the layout of a page. If you already created the web form for your PDF in PlatoForms, you can cope with this case in an elegant way and save lots of effort without building a new form from scratch.  

Go to `Dashboard`, move the mouse over that old version PDF, press that `gear icon` and select "Clone Form" in its dropdown menu. In the popup dialogue, you can turn off `Reuse PDF File` and turn on `Reuse Form Widgets` then press `Clone`.

In next step, you just upload the new version PDF. After the upload succeeds, the form builder is open with all old version form widgets. They lay in the new version PDF with the same place in old one. The following steps are pretty straightforward - if you added a field in PDF, then add its corresponding field in form builder.  If your PDF has a new layout, then dragging the PDF widgets into the new place.

With clone form, you can create the form for a new version PDF in a few seconds! More than that, you can choose `Reuse PDF File` to create a different web form for the same PDF. In a rare case, you even can turn on both `Reuse` option and tweak a new web form for the same PDF.

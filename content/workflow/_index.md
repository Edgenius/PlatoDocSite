Workflow helps you fill a PDF in multiple step. 

To explanin what is workflow, let's start with a use case. For example, you are a car sale agency, you have a PDF that needs your customer fill out the personal information first.  Then the sales manager sign on the PDF to approve the sale.  For this case, you can create a workflow with two steps. The first step could be an Online Web Form which is ease-to-fill for any customers. The second step could be PDF Online Form which has a signagure pad. By workflow step settings, the 2nd step can use the first step created PDF as form template, so the sales manager can easily understand what they approved for.

Dropdown is very similar with `Choice` field. They are all for selection operation. However, Choice normally is rendered to `tick` or `cross` sign although its other option can include text. But dropdown is rendered to text in your PDF. 


## Value and Label

The `Value` is invisible in form but it is the text in your PDF. In your form, user only see these `Label`s. In most case, they could be same. But you also can make them different. For example, if you want to show countries in your dropdown, they are normally full name of the countries. But in PDF, you may want to show the country code.

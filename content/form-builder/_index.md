After you upload the PDF, the next page will ask what kind of form you want to build. There are 2 options: the online web form or the online PDF form. 

#### Online Web Form
It transforms your PDF form into a web form that is easy for everyone to fill out. It is compatible with all web browsers, provides great mobile experience and fast page loading. 
It will take more effort to build the form because you have to cover the web form and PDF fieldsâ€™ mappings.


#### Online PDF Form
It is easy to build, keeps all the details from your original PDF, and is suitable for any complex PDF form. 
This form is only compatible with the latest web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari or Edge, but not IE. Its page loading speed could be slightly slower if your PDF has many images.

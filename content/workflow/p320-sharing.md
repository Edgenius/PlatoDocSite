Once you have designed the workflow, you need to publish it and then share it or embed it to your website.

- To share your workflow, click the *share icon* in the *action panel* to the side of your workflow name. 

- To publish, click *Publish the Workflow* in the pop-up window. 

  Once the workflow is published, the steps become **read-only**. This means you cannot change, delete or add another step. If you need to make changes, *Clone* the workflow and start again.

There are three statuses for a workflow:

- **Draft**
  This is the initial status of a workflow. You can make any changes you require.

- **Published**
  A published workflow can be shared and accept submissions. Once a workflow is published, you cannot make any further changes.

- **Broken**

  A workflow becomes broken when one or more forms in the form archive are archived, deleted, or sharing is stopped. To fix a broken form, make sure all forms are in published status.

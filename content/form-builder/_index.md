PlatoForms can build 3 kinds of forms.  `Online Web Form`, `Online PDF Form` and `Master Form`. On our dashboard main menu, pressing that big purple **Start to Build** button, it pops up a small menu. The first menu item *Create Online Form for an Existing PDF* is the entry to build `Online Web Form` or `Online PDF Form`. The second menu item *Create Master Form for Multiple PDFs* is for building a `Master Form` .

Clicking the first menu item, it asks you upload a PDF. After that, the next page asks what kind of form you want to build, i.e, `Online Web Form` or `Online PDF Form`. Here is this form type picker page looks like:

#### Online Web Form
It transforms your PDF form into a web form that is easy for everyone to fill out. It is compatible with all web browsers, provides great mobile experience and fast page loading. 
It will take more effort to build the form because you have to cover the web form and PDF fieldsâ€™ mappings.


#### Online PDF Form
It is easy to build, keeps all the details from your original PDF, and is suitable for any complex PDF form. 
This form is only compatible with the latest web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari or Edge, but not IE. Its page loading speed could be slightly slower if your PDF has many images.


Pressing on *Create Master Form for Multiple PDFs* on that dashboard popup menu , it opens the master form editor directly.

#### Master Form
It builds a web form that does not link to any PDF initially.  After you leave the master form editor, you can upload the PDF files to build so-called `Linked PDF Forms`.  In link form editor, you can pick up any form widgets from its mater form and mapping it to your PDF.  As you can upload and build any amount linked form against the same master form, once you got submissions to this master form, all its linked form will generates the PDF files base on the linked mapping.

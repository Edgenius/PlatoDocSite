# PlatoForms Documentation


PlatoForms is a service to help you convert your PDF into a common form in web page.  Filling out the PDF is always challenge. Even you make a fillable PDF file, your customers may still don't know how to fill in it. In contrast, the form in web page is a common way to collect data. Everyone knows how to use it if he/she knows how to surf the Internet!

PlatoForms helps conquer this problem. You can use its form builder to create a web form which links the fields in your PDF.  When your customers are filling in the form in web page, they even don't know they are filling out a PDF!  Once PlatoForms gets the submission, it will convert the data into your PDF. 

PlatoForms is good way to collect data from your customers or your teams. But it is not suitable for:
* If you only want to fill the PDF once.
* If your PDF form is extremely complicated. Although PlatoForms can handle this, the web form could be too long to fill. Except you want to use it inside your team and they are not very care about this.

PlatoForms can handle various format PDF, like multiple pages PDF, even a scanned PDF. It is pretty easy to use. In most case, you can create the forms even you don't need to read this document.

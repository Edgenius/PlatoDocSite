Once a user fills in and submits a form, an email with the generated PDF is sent to your inbox. You will also get a new submission notification in your PlatoForms dashboard.

Manage your submissions from the *Submissions* page. From there, you can:

* View submissions data
* View workflow progress and submissions
* Search by submission data
* Export all raw data in CSV format
* Download, re-generate or delete a PDF
* Look-up any submission revisions
* Download attached files (if your form has any Upload File fields)

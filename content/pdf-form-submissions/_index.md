After your form gets submission, you will get an email notification. You also can check out the notifications from our dashboard. 

`Submission Page` is a more powerful place to manage the submissions. You can

* View the submitted data
* Search by submitted data
* Download, re-generate or delete PDF
* Download attached files if your form has `Upload File` fields

At initial, you only can view the submitted time. Searching is also not enabled. Press "Edit Display Field", then you can select which fields you want to display or search.

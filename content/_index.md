# PlatoForms Documentation


PlatoForms is a service to help you convert your PDF into a common form in a web page. Filling out the PDF is always challenge. Even you make a fillable PDF file, your clients may still don't know how to fill out. In contrast, the form on the web page is an easy way to collect data. Everyone knows how to use it if they know how to surf the Internet!

PlatoForms helps to conquer this problem. You can use our form builder to create a web page which links the form fields to your PDF.  When your clients are filling in the form on the web page, they even don't know they are filling out a PDF! When PlatoForms gets the submission, it immediately converts the submitted data into your PDF and notifies you. 

PlatoForms is a good way to collect data from your clients or your team members. It is NOT the service if you only need to fill the PDF ONCE.


PlatoForms can handle various format PDF, such as multiple pages PDF, PDF with various images or even a scanned PDF. PlatoForms is pretty easy to use. In most case, you don't need to read this document, just upload your PDF and play with the form builder.

The PDF Maker is an editor to create a PDF (Form) document from scratch. In top toolbar, you can add various PDF widget to the PDF page canvas. The new widget initial put on the top of the page. You can drop-and-drop it to anywhere on this page. Dragging the widget corner, you also can resize the widget. If the widget is selected, on the left side of the page, it is the properties of this fields. You can change them to your want. If there is no any selected widget,  the properties panel will display the page list of this PDF. At there, you can drag the page to re-order them. You also can delete any particular pages. 

In the top of function bar, you can preview the PDF in a new window. After you completed your PDF form design, pressing the "Make Online Form" button, PlatoForms tries to convert this PDF to an online form. All PDF widgets are mapped to relevant online form fields. You still have to assign the label, help text or placeholder for these online fields. The reason is, in PDF Maker, it doesn't have relation between the label to widgets (e.g, Input Box, Dropdown or Signature etc.) To minor your typing effort, PlatoForms extracts all text and pops an auto-completion menu under your input. You can convert this PDF to the online form any times. It will ask if you want to merge with existed online form (if you have created before) or create a new one.

There is no limitation how many PDF you can create, it is 100% free for our sign-up users.

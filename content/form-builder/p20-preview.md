#### Disable Form Validation
Normally, the form may have some validation at your submission. For example, maximum or minimum length of a input field, or numeric value is required etc. However, in multiple pages form, you may want to preview the 2nd page. In normal case, you have to fill all required data in the 1st page, click "next" to jump to 2nd page. You can turn off "Form Validation" from the top bar of preview page, so even you don't fill any data or your just filled some invalid data, you still can click "Next" button to jump to 2nd page.


#### Fill Sample Data

In form builder, you can fill some data in preview section of field property popup. These data can be used to fill in the preview form.  For example, if you already input "John Joe"  in a text input field, at preview form, click "Fill Preview Data" button in the top function bar, the specified input field will automatically fill in "John Joe" as sample data. This can save lots of your time when you want to preview generated PDF after form submitted.

Note, not all fields can be pre-filling.  Only SingleText MultiText, Choice, Dropdown and Signature can have sample data. For File Upload or Captcha, you have to fill them for submission.

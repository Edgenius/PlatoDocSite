![Form Designer](/images/page/form-preview/form-designer.png)

Your change is reflecting to form preview immediately if your form has corresponding widgets. Only when you explicitly click `Apply` button, the changes are saved. Also, only when you publish this form (again), the new look-and-feel will be exposed to public users. You can `Revert` your change to last save state or `Reset to default` to restore to our default look and feel. 

In form designer second tab, you can paste your CSS styles into that text box. Likewise, this CSS only apply to the new form when you publish the form (again).  These styles have higher priority and will overwrite those default styles.

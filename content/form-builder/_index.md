After you upload the PDF, the next page will ask what kind of form you want to build. There are 2 options: the online web form or the online PDF form. 

#### Online Web Form
It maps your PDF form to a web form that anyone knows how to fill out. It is compatible with all browsers, with better mobile experience and very fast page loading. 
It will take more effort to build the form because you have to take care both the web form and the PDF fields mappings.

As a sample, this is the original PDF[link]. Here is the online web form looks like:

#### Online PDF Form
It is easy to build, keeps any details from your original PDF, suitable for any complex PDF form. 
The created form is only compatible with the latest browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari or Edge, but not IE. Its page loading could be a bit slow if your PDF has many images.

**Designing the form**

In the Form Preview toolbar, click *Design Form* to open the Form Designer side panel. Use the form designer to customise the look and feel of your form.

**Saving the form**
Changes are visible live on the form, which lets you experiment until you get things right. When you're finished, click *Apply* to save your changes.

**Viewing changes**
The next time you publish your form, it will reflect the changes and adopt the new look-and-feel for public users. If you're not happy with your changes, you can revert the design back to the last saved state, or reset to defaultâ€”it's up to you.

**Custom CSS**
On the Form Designer, click the CSS tab, and add your CSS styles to the text box. Custom CSS will override any other styling set in the designer. To save your styles, click *Apply*. Any changes will be visible the next time you publish a form.

The form previews are fully functioning; you can **fill them out** and **submit them** in the same way as a published form.

### Disabling Form Validaiton

Typically, when you submit a form, it will run some validation checksâ€”for example, maximum characters, numeric value. On a live form this is a valuable process, but on a preview, it can cause complications.

Turn *Form Validation* **on** and **off** with the *toggle switch* in your preview *Toolbar*. This allows you to submit a form, even if the content is not valid.

### Fill Sample Data

When you preview your form, click *Fill Sample Data* in the top right *Toolbar*, and the fields will automatically populate with your example data. 



### Previewing the PDF after form submission

After submitting a form, you can **view the generated PDF** from the success page. Click *Preview PDF* in the top right *Toolbar*.
